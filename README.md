To start 

Getting Started (Super Simple)

1. Create a virtual environment in the project directory:
`python -m venv .venv`

2. Activate the virtual environment and install dependencies:
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

3. Run the app:
`python app.py`


4. Join a room:
Open your browser and go to:
`https://localhost:5001/anyRoomId`
Replace anyRoomId with any room name or ID you like.


5. Connect from another browser or device:
Open the link on another browser or computer and enter the same email to join the room.
It should work immediately for video/audio communication.


Notes:
WebRTC requires HTTPS to work in most browsers. For local communication, it can also work over HTTP.
WebRTC may not work on Microsoft Edge, but it works on Google Chrome. Compatibility with other browsers is not guaranteed.
